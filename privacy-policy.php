            <p>Welcome to our Privacy Policy page. When you use our web site services, you trust us with your
                information. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect
                it, and what we do with it. This is important; we hope you will take time to read it carefully.</p>
                <hr />
            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect information to provide better services to all our users. We collect information in the
                following ways:</p>
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <li>Information you give us. For example, our service requires you to sign up for an account. When you
                    do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit
                    card.</li>
                <li>Information we get from your use of our services. We collect information about the services that you
                    use and how you use them, like when you visit a website that uses our advertising services or you
                    view and interact with our ads and content.</li>
            </div>
            <hr />
            <h2>How We Use Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve
                them, to develop new ones, and to protect our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored
                content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads.</p>
                <hr />
            <h2>Information We Share</h2>
            <p>We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of our company
                unless one of the following circumstances applies:</p>
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <li>With your consent. We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals
                    outside of our company when we have your consent to do so.</li>
                <li>For legal reasons. We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals
                    outside of our company if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure
                    of the information is reasonably necessary to:</li>
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <li>Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.</li>
                    <li>Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.</li>
                    <li>Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</li>
                    <li>Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of our company, our users or the public
                        as required or permitted by law.</li>
                </div>
            </div>
            <hr />
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>We work hard to protect our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or
                destruction of information we hold. In particular:</p>
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <li>We encrypt many of our services using SSL.</li>
                <li>We offer you two step verification when you access your account.</li>
                <li>We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors and agents who need to know
                    that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual
                    confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these
                    obligations.</li>
            </div>
            <hr />
            <h2>Changes</h2>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy
                without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes
                are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email
                notification of privacy policy changes).</p>
